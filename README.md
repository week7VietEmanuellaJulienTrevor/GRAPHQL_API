#### This week we were asked to create a Rest Api allowing GraphQL queries for Rocket Elevators.This was done with the use of our databases from the past weeks.

### How to use GraphIQL:

1. Access your file and run "Bundle Install";
1. Go to your local host on a web browser: http://localhost:3000/graphiql;
1. Add the query on the left panel then press the play button on the top left.

- Retrieving the address of the building, the beginning and the end of the intervention for a specific intervention. The Id's can be changed as needed.
```
{
    newquery1(id: 201) {
        interventions {
            startDateIntervention
            endDateIntervention
            address {
                numberAndStreet
                suiteOrApartment
                city
                country
                postalCode
            }
        }
    }
}

```
- Retrieving customer information and the list of interventions that took place for a specific building.
```
{
    newquery2(id: 6) {
        customer {
            id
            addressId
            fullNameCompanyContact
            companyName
            companyDescription
            companyContactPhone
            companyHeadquarterAddress
            customerCreationDate
        }
        interventions {
            id
            batteryId
            columnId
            elevatorId
            employeeId
            status
            result
            startDateIntervention
            endDateIntervention
            report
        }
    }
}
```

- Retrieval of all interventions carried out by a specified employee with the buildings associated with these interventions including the details (Table BuildingDetails) associated with these buildings.
```
{
    newquery3(id: 10) {
        employee {
            id
            firstName
            lastName
            interventions {
                description
                id
                endDateIntervention
                startDateIntervention
                status
                result
                report
                building {
                    description
                    id
                    addressOfTheBuilding
                    fullNameOfTheBuildingAdministrator
                    fullNameOfTheTechnicalContactForTheBuilding
                    emailOfTheAdministratorOfTheBuilding
                    technicalContactEmailForTheBuilding
                    phoneNumberOfTheBuildingAdministrator
                    technicalContactPhoneForTheBuilding
                    buildingDetail {
                        informationKey
                        value
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Testing with Postman 
* Clicking on the button will send you to the postman collection (Rocket-Elevator-GraphqlAPI). Inside Postman you can click on the button "Runner" which will execute a sequence, retrieving and changing the information before restoring for further tests. (Supplied in the Codeboxx deliverable)
